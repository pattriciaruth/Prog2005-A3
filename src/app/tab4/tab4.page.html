    <h1>Privacy & Security Requirements<br>for Mobile Applications</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      This application manages inventory data and interacts with a remote server. 
      As part of modern mobile development, it is essential to follow strong privacy and 
      security practices to ensure that all user and system data is protected.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2>1. Secure Communication</h2>
    <p>
      All communication between the app and the backend must occur over 
      <strong>HTTPS</strong> to protect data from interception or tampering. 
      This includes all GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h2>2. Data Validation & Sanitisation</h2>
    <p>
      The app ensures that all user-input fields such as item names, quantities and categories
      are validated before being sent to the server. Input validation prevents attacks such as
      injection, malformed data and accidental corruption of database records.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h2>3. Restricted Access to Sensitive Operations</h2>
    <p>
      Updating and deleting records must be restricted to authorised users. 
      Although this demonstration system does not implement authentication,
      the production version would require secure login, role-based access control (RBAC),
      and session management.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h2>4. Avoid Storing Sensitive Data Locally</h2>
    <p>
      Mobile devices can be lost or compromised. Therefore, the application avoids
      storing sensitive information on the device. Temporary cache or in-memory data structures
      are used instead of persistent local storage.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <h2>5. API Error Handling & Safe Responses</h2>
    <p>
      All API responses are handled safely. Error messages are displayed to the user
      without exposing internal server details. This prevents information leakage
      which could be exploited by attackers.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <h2>6. Protection Against Unauthorised Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      The backend prevents deletion of protected items (e.g., “Laptop”) to demonstrate
      tamper-resistant design. This aligns with secure data-handling practices
      where critical records require elevated permissions.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <h2>7. Ethical Data Handling</h2>
    <p>
      User data must be treated ethically following organisational policies and
      privacy regulations. Access should be limited to legitimate educational
      or operational purposes only.
    </p>
